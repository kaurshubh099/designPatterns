# Abstract Factory Pattern

In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern. 

An Abstract Factory Pattern is also known as Kit.

### Difference between factory and Abstract factory Pattern
1. The main difference between a “factory method” and an “abstract factory” is that the factory method is a single method, and an abstract factory is an object.
2. The factory method is just a method, it can be overridden in a subclass, whereas the abstract factory is an object that has multiple factory methods on it.
3. The Factory Method pattern uses inheritance and relies on a subclass to handle the desired object instantiation.
